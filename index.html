                                    top of their game. We combine a unique system of holistic living and scientifically
                                    proven training methods to maximize your performance and minimize injury. We
                                    recognize that what happens outside of training is just as important as what happens
                                    during training. Our coaches are trained to teach athletes proper technique and
                                    mechanics as well as protocols to maximize recovery and well-being.

                                                    sport athlete. As an athlete he was always looking for ways to
                                                    improve his performance. He realized that being the best was much
                                                    more than just training hard in the gym. To fulfill his dream of
                                                    being a world class athlete, he had to learn how to optimize every
                                                    aspect of his life: physically, mentally, emotionally, and
                                                    spiritually.

                                                    Coach. She began her professional career in the Newborn Intensive
                                                    Care Unit helping to care for critically ill and premature babies.
                                                    After 3 years of working night shift as a graduate nurse and putting
                                                    her career first, she realized she needed to start putting herself

                                                    being active came very natural to her. A friend connected her with a

                                                    training. She had no idea that a brand new form of exercise would
                                                    become a sport that sparked a fire within her that she never felt

                                                    Through weightlifting, she started to develop a healthy relationship
                                                    with food and learned the importance of fueling her body in ways
                                                    that facilitate the best performance. Not only did she start making
                                                    progress in the gym but she was also feeling more in control of her
                                                    mental and emotional state as well. She was becoming more in tune
                                                    with her body and learned to pay attention to what her body was
                                                    telling her with each choice she made. This allowed her to love and
                                                    trust her body for all it was capable of instead of only equating
                                                    her worth with her outward appearance or a number on the scale.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                    In order for her to continue to implement a healthy lifestyle, she
                                                    realized that she needed to come off of night shift which ultimately
                                                    led her to transition from working with babies to accepting a new
                                                    position. She continued to follow what her heart was telling her and
                                                    began studying holistic health. Through her studies, she has
                                                    developed an understanding of what optimal health looks like. With
                                                    the knowledge she has, it has become more apparent to her that her
                                                    duty in serving others as a nurse is not being fulfilled in the way
                                                    that she feels people deserve or in a way that fulfills her own
                                                    heart.

                                                    Taylor's very own journey and continuous education has helped her
                                                    discover that we all have magic inside of us that sometimes needs a
                                                    little help finding. She is dedicated to helping others learn to
                                                    love, trust, and believe in themselves in order to actualize their
                                                    potential and accomplish their goals and dreams.

                            <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
                            <p>Founded by Nathan Barna and Taylor Baroth, Opimal Evolution was created in response to
                                seeing so many coaches, trainers, therapists, dietitians, and doctors misguiding people
                                and/or not addressing the root causes of an individual's disease, poor health, or
                                diminished performance. Through a holistic approach, we teach people how to create
                                health, happiness, strength, and vitality in their lives so that they have the greatest
                                opportunity to reach their dreams. We treat each individual as a complete, integrated
                                system, recognizing the synergistic effort that all body systems have on one another.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our practice teaches people to develop a relationship with their body so that they
                                ultimately gain the power to be their own guiding force to the life they want to live.
                                We believe that most ailments occur through the mismanagement of one’s lifestyle choices
                                that can be traced back to a few key principles. And through embracing and optimizing
                                these principles one learns how to create a body that is free of sickness and disease,
                                capable of achieving the highest levels of human potential: physically, mentally,
                                emotionally, and spiritually.
                            </p>

                            <p>It is our mission is to be a source of light for those that recognize the importance of
                                aligning mind, body, soul, and spirit to create not only a better life for oneself, but
                                to use one’s love and health for the betterment of all life. Change must happen on a
                                personal level before it can happen on global and universal level. By helping yourself
                                first you are putting yourself in a position to help those around you.
                            </p>

                            <p>Whether your dream is to be an elite athlete or to be the best parent, teacher, husband,
                                or sister you can be, our goal is to guide your through your journey and help you
                                discover your own Optimal Evolution.
                            </p>
